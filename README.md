Several applications of cloud computing can provide substantial financial benefits to businesses. Cloud computing is a computer paradigm and collection of technologies that enable users to access cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis over the Internet.

Despite being a relatively new paradigm that has only just gained popularity, cloud computing is growing in popularity by the day.

The many uses of cloud computing have proved efficient in offering various solutions to various issues, from NGOs to non-profit organizations, government agencies and tiny start-ups.

Have you implemented cloud computing in your business? If you haven't, it's probably because you don't comprehend its applications and the benefits they may provide for your company.

The following are some frequent applications of cloud computing that should encourage you to think about how this technology may help your organization.

### 1. Storage of files

There are several choices for storing and accessing your data. There's your laptop's hard disk, an external hard drive for backing up and transferring data, network file sharing, USB devices, and more.

What distinguishes cloud storage from other storage options?

The primary reason why cloud storage is desirable is that data may be easily viewed and updated. 

Cloud storage comes in a variety of different forms, including block, file, and object storage. These each meet various use cases from shared filesystems to block-based volumes to backup and archiving systems.

Cloud computing storage services such as DropBox, Amazon S3 or OneDrive give safe access and scalability to expand or reduce storage based on your demands and budget. As a result, this form of storage is not only secure but also relatively inexpensive.

### 2. Analytics Using Big Data

Today, if your company does not gather big data, it will be at a considerable disadvantage. This might include information on your customers, market trends, sales success, and other factors.

Businesses require big data of all sizes for a variety of reasons. Some gather it to uncover new chances for company growth, while others solve complicated issues.
Extensive data collection and analysis, on the other hand, is a difficult task. It necessitates the employment of massive computational resources, which come at a high cost.
If you buy the resources needed for cloud computing, you may have to cut expenditures for other essential services like marketing. This is something you can avoid if you use cloud computing.

The significant advantage of cloud computing is that it has a pay-as-you-go pricing model. This means you won't have to pay for unused time, which will save your company a lot of money. You use and pay for resources when you need them.

Without a doubt, cloud computing simplifies utilities and reduces the cost of big data analytics. For additional information, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] provides a variety of analytics services for various use cases.

### 3. Data backups and archiving

We now live in a society where cybercrime is commonplace. No day goes by without reports of massive data breaches, which may be catastrophic for several organizations.
For a long time, traditional data backup methods have shown to be successful in backing up data. Nonetheless, they are vulnerable to infections, and because they are portable, they may go misplaced and represent a threat to modern enterprises.

Cloud backup and archiving provide a solution to these issues. It is simple to set up and ensures optimum data security. You can backup or archive your sensitive information to cloud-based storage systems using this method. This ensures that your data remains intact even if your live data is hacked in any way.

Some cloud computing providers allow you to schedule backups based on your requirements. You may also encrypt your cloud backups to prevent hackers and snoopers from accessing them.

You can obtain as much space as you need and keep as much data as you need with cloud storage, and you only pay for what you use.

### 4. Reconstruction after a disaster

According to research, more than 75% of businesses that face a crisis and do not have a disaster recovery strategy collapse within three years of the event.

Building a disaster recovery site and evaluating your business continuity strategy has traditionally been an incredibly costly and time-consuming process.
But it doesn't have to be the case anymore!

You may create a disaster recovery system in the cloud using cloud computing. In this strategy, you construct a copy of your production site and replicate data and configuration settings continuously.

In the case of a disaster at your production site, you may quickly and easily deploy your apps and data services in the cloud and get your business back up and running.
CloudEndure by AWS is an example of an automated and managed disaster recovery system

### 5. Software development and testing

If you've ever built an in-house application or software, you'll know that the process is time-consuming, expensive, and costly. It necessitates the installation and deployment of sophisticated gear and software and the ongoing training of all personnel involved.

Said, a simple job might take months to complete, putting you at a disadvantage in today's ultra-competitive industry.

Continuous integration and continuous delivery solutions are available from cloud computing companies, making development and testing faster, less complicated, and less expensive.

With cloud development tools, you may get an advantage by decreasing your software delivery lifecycle time.

PaaS (Platform as a Service) (PaaS) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and 

Running real servers and virtualization infrastructure to host your virtual machines necessitates significant IT infrastructure acquisition and management investments.
Businesses are turning to cloud computing to save money since its pay-per-use pricing system offers the right balance of quality and affordability. With Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), you may eliminate your VMware licensing expenses as well as the hardware on which your virtual servers run.

This is because IaaS allows you to deploy virtual computers, also known as "instances," in the cloud without having to handle any of the underlying hardware or hosting software.
But what if you don't want to handle the instances or their operating system software at all?  When you use the PaaS computing paradigm, you upload your code to the cloud provider, and everything is taken care of for you to launch and operate your cloud application.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an example of a PaaS service. This service allows you to upload code, and Elastic Beanstalk will create your Amazon EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, Elastic Load Balancers, and even Amazon RDS databases.

### 7. Interaction

People can use cloud computing to access cloud-based communication tools such as calendars and emails. Furthermore, messaging and telephony apps like WhatsApp and Skype are built on cloud infrastructure.
The messages and data you send and receive are kept in the cloud, not on your smartphone. This allows you to access them through the internet from any device and anywhere on the planet.

Social Networking 8th.

Social networking is one of the most underutilized uses of cloud computing. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are examples of cloud computing models that use Software as a Service (SaaS).

Social media platforms are designed to assist you in finding individuals you know â€” or connecting with people you don't know. They also provide many methods for exchanging information and data, such as tweets, pictures, instant messaging, and [blogs].

Along with cloud storage, one of the most frequent use cases for consumer-driven cloud service utilization is social networking.

### 9th. Business procedure

You have already included cloud computing into your management approach if you use company management tools such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and ERP. 
These enterprise-level apps are delivered via software (SaaS), mainly relying on cloud computing technologies. They provide simple maintenance, security, and administration of your company's critical resources. Furthermore, they give maximum efficiency to both service providers and their customers.

### The Ending

Cloud computing is undeniably a developing business, and there are several favorable applications for cloud computing services. New companies are increasingly migrating to the cloud, which has become the ideal medium for software testing and development, communication, storage, and deployment.

With all of these cloud computing applications and the benefits described above, there is no reason why you shouldn't start incorporating cloud computing into your organization today to obtain a competitive edge.
